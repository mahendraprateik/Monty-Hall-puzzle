# Monty-Hall-puzzle

Monty Hall problem is a famour probability puzzle which is so counter intuitive that most people get it wrong the first time.

So what is the the problem and where did it originate?
The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle named after Monty Hall, the original host of the TV show Let’s Make a Deal. It’s a famous paradox that has a solution that is so absurd, most people refuse to believe it’s true.

Suppose you are deemed to win a prize if you select the correct door out of the three doors presented to you. However, after you choose a door, the host (Monty Hall) shows you what is behind one of the two doors
that you did not choose (The host would always open a door with nothing behind it). Now yoou are left with 2 doors, the door that you chose and the door that was neither chosen by you nor was it opened by the host.

WOULD YOU SWITCH?

The correct answer is that....if you do switch yoour chances of winning double up from if yoou do not switch.
BUT HOW? is'nt is simple math that there arer 2 doors, one with a prize, one without it. Should the answer be not 50% (half chance)?

Lets see, if you were presented with just 2 doors, and asked to pick one of them, then yes, the answer would have been 50%.
But if we had another door previously, that adds a layer of simple complexity (I know it is a paradox).

Here my shot at a simple an intuitive explanation which I understood.

Step 1:
You choose a door from door 1, 2 and 3. Lets say yooou chose dooor 2. 33% of the times you pick the prize, 66% of the times you do not.

Step 2:
The host reveals what is behind one of the other two doors that you did not select (keep in mind that the host will always open a door with no prize)
Now lets say the host reveals door 3 and shows you that there is nothing behind it and asks yoou the main question, "Would you want to switch to door 1 or stick to door 2 ?"

Now read carefully:
Statement 1: Lets go back to step 1 for a second. Initially had a higher chance (66%) of NOT winning. So MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, you picked the wrong door.
Statement 2: The host reveals one of the remaining door and confirms that there is no prize behind it. The host ALWAYS opens an incorrect door as part of the game.

Now combine the 2 statements and think, if you were highly likely to pick an incorrect door at first, and then the host reveals the other incorrect door, what are the remaining options?
The only option left is the dooor that was neither selected by you, not opoened by the host. So there is a higher chance that the door that you ignored initially as it had 33% chance of
having a prize behind it (just like the other doors), now has a 66% chance of having the prize ONLY because the host revealed a door with no prize.
